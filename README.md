1. The distribution of speeches by country, category and dynamics in annual terms is shown.
2. Topics of speeches. The categories are splited by ratio, applause, laughter and country.
3. Authors of speeches. The areas of activity of the authors, the number of their presentations and the number of views are reflected.
4. Others category shown in details.
